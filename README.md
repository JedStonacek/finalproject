My final project is useful if you want to converting dynamic viscosity across different units.
To use our project, start by typing in any value into the edit box. The value must be entered in (kg/m*s) 
to be converted correctly.
At the touch of the the two radio buttons the inputed value will converted to either (lbm/ft*s) or (lbm/ft*hr).
The new value will be presented in matlab in the command window.
hfluxlbh = (lbm/ft*hr)
hfluxlbs = (lbm/ft*s)
